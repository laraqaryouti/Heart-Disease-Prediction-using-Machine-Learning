# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

As part of the "Complete A.I. & Machine Learning, Data Science Bootcamp" on Udemy by Andrei Neagoie and Daniel Bourke, I successfully completed Milestone Project 1, which involved developing an end-to-end machine learning project for predicting heart disease.

## Objective:
The primary goal of this project was to create a predictive model capable of assessing the likelihood of heart disease based on a set of input features. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project contributes to the field of healthcare by providing a tool that could assist in early detection and risk assessment.

## Key Features:
Utilized a diverse dataset containing relevant medical parameters, enabling the model to learn patterns and associations crucial for accurate predictions.
Employed three machine learning algorithms for classification tasks which are: 1. Logestic Regression 2. Random Forest 3. K-Nearest Neighbors.

## Results:
Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were carefully considered to ensure the reliability of the predictions.
